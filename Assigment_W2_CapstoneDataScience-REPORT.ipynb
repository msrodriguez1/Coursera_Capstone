    "Particulary in this report the target city to be planed it Santiago de Chile. Santiago de Chile is a huge city with  5.2 million inhabitants , that is the third part of the total population of Chile. This city is the capital of the country. Different types of neighbourhoods exists in Santiago, some of them are very rich and others very poor, but what they have in common is that were not planned. That explains why people have to travel from neighbourhood to neihbourhood to find a store, bank o go to school or job. That reduce life quality of the inhabitants and make it more expensive. "

To do that a model with be built to caracterize the neighbourhood of cosmopolitan cities. The model wil be train with the data of New York, Toronto, Paris, Sydney, Melbourne and London.
